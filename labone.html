	  The objective of this lab was to test an Arduino Uno board, as well as eventually create a moving robot by the end of the lab. </br>
	  We inserted a 300 Ohm Resistor in series for safety to avoid damaging any of our components, and tested all the pins.</br>
	  For Lab 1, we first tested an LED as well as, in the process, the connectors of our Arduino Uno microcontroller.</br>
	  After testing all the pins to see if our board was working, we attempted to change the brightness of the LED as instructed in the lab. </br>
	  We encountered some trouble in getting an output for the brightness, as well as some issues with the connections in our circuit.</br>
	  Meanwhile, we also started working on connecting the parts of our robot and circuit, mainly the servo.</br>
	  We got into some issues getting our servo to work correctly, until realized that we were supposed to connect it to the Arduino</br>
	  rather than the battery; it was acting erraticly before we fixed this oversight.</br>
	  Eventually, we better organized our circuit to fit on our robot and managed to get the breadboard on top of it.</br>
	  Our wire management made our work and testing much easier, compared to the usual mess of wires that a circuit usually becomes.</br>
	  </br>
	  After all the hardware handiwork, we returned to coding to program our board and Parallax servo to move in a controlled manner;</br>
	  we tested front and back movement as well as making the robot turn. While working, we noticed that the robot would do things completely</br> 
	  unexpectedly, such as being able to move with our code being full of errors, so much so that the robot shouldn't have been able to do<i> anything. </i> </br>
	  
	  Once we understood and figured out how to control our robot through the software, we began to test different ways we wanted</br>
	  the robot to move, such as tweaking the speed of the wheels so we could eventually make it move <i> nearly </i> straight. </br>
	  This part of the lab took the most trial and error, because, as we quickly learned, we had to make our software work for the hardware (eg. the wheels), </br>
	  rather than the other way around. We predict that this will probably be a common theme in our future ECE 3400 labs and projects. </br>
	  
	  </br>
	  
	  Finally, we got our robot to move in a specific pattern: we made it move in a square, or at least very close to that.</br>
	  We got it to move straight in one direction for some time, and programmed it to turn 90 degrees after that time. </br>
